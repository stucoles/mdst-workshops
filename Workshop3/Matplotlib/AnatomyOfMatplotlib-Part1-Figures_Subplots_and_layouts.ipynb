    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the beginning to serve two purposes: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots\n",
    " 2. make it easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. \n",
    " \n",
    "Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system."

    "## Online Documentation\n",
    "The [matplotlib.org](http://matplotlib.org) project website is the primary online resource for the library's documentation. It contains the [example galleries](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html), [FAQs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/index.html), [API documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/index.html), and [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gallery\n",
    "Many users of Matplotlib are often faced with the question, \"I want to make a figure that has X with Y in the same figure, but it needs to look like Z\". Good luck getting an answer from a web search with that query! This is why the [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) is so useful, because it showcases the variety of ways one can make figures. Browse through the gallery, click on any figure that has pieces of what you want to see and the code that generated it. Soon enough, you will be like a chef, mixing and matching components to produce your masterpiece!\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, if you have a new and interesting plot that demonstrates a feature of Matplotlib, feel free to submit a concise, well-commented version of the code for inclusion in the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mailing Lists, StackOverflow, and gitter\n",
    "When you are just simply stuck, and cannot figure out how to get something to work, or just need some hints on how to get started, you will find much of the community at the matplotlib-users [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users). This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. We love plots, so an image showing what is wrong often gets the quickest responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another community resource is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib), so if you need to build up karma points, submit your questions here, and help others out too! \n",

    "We are also on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Github repository\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib) is hosted by GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bug Reports and feature requests\n",
    "So, you think you found a bug? Or maybe you think some feature is just too difficult to use? Or missing altogether? Submit your bug reports [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) at Matplotlib's issue tracker. We even have a process for submitting and discussing Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals ([MEPs](https://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/index.html))."

    "\n",
    "Most plotting ocurs on an ``Axes``.  The axes is effectively the area that we plot data on and any ticks/labels/etc associated with it.  Usually we'll set up an Axes with a call to ``subplot`` (which places Axes on a regular grid), so in most cases, ``Axes`` and ``Subplot`` are synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ``Axes`` has an ``XAxis`` and a ``YAxis``.  These contain the ticks, tick locations, labels, etc.  In this tutorial, we'll mostly control ticks, tick labels, and data limits through other mechanisms, so we won't touch the individual ``Axis`` part of things all that much.
